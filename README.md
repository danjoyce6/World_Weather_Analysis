# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to utilize the Google Maps Directions API to retrieve weather data, create a customer destination map, and to create a travel itenerary map.  Jupyter notebooks, Pandas, and Gmaps were used to create the maps listed earlier.  The final product was interactive maps taken from google maps API to display travel itenerary, retrieve weather data, and create a customer destination map.

## Results
The following image displays city latitude versus max temperature.

# Conclusion
The Google Maps Directions API was used successfully as demonstrated by the images and notebooks to retrieve weather data, create a customer destination map, and create a travel itenerary map.
